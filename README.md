Magmi GitHub

This is the Official GitHub home for magmi  project (Magento Mass Importer), the original Git is hosted on sourceforge but this github repo will
be kept in sync.


Magmi Wiki is still hosted at sourceforge.

Huge UI rework ongoing
========================

The "newui" branch has a master UI rework ongoing and a "security first" approach.

if you use this branch, use the following url <magmi base url>/magmi/web/v2/index.php and you'll see many enhancements.

First, it will "force" you to secure your server (and will do it automatically for an apache 2.4.x)

The new ui uses bootstrap but is currently unusable (but then nothing prevents you to switch back to old UI and you'll have a secured access)

Magmi new UI will secure access with magento database credentials and will protect whole magmi dir (old & new UI as well as base code)

Magento CE 1.8.x  & 1.9.x Support
===================================

Magmi needs you to test it against Magento CE 1.8.x. & Magento CE 1.9.x

It should work for most of it, and maybe it's already working well.

But devil is in the details and i don't have much time doing an extensive test session.

So , if you are using Magento CE 1.8.x or CE 1.9.x , please provide bug reports for any found defects or any incompatibility you might have noticed.
